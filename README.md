# ERA5-Precipitation-Processor
This repository contains a suite of R scripts designed for the post-processing and analysis of ERA5 reanalysis data, with a specific focus on total precipitation. The scripts automate key steps in the data workflow, from converting raw NetCDF files to GeoTIFFs to performing statistical aggregations and generating site-specific reports.
